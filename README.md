### Projects

#### ☸️ [Kubernetes on Digital Ocean](https://github.com/kzwolenik95/kubernetes-on-digitalocean)

This project was developed to showcase the automated deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean, employing Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and GitOps practices for configuration management.

- Automated Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean using Terraform and Flux CD, integrating Vault, Kong ingress with TLS and Prometheus stack for monitoring
- It demonstrates my expertise in deploying a secure, observable Kubernetes cluster using modern DevOps methodologies
- it integrates various cloud-native technologies and follows best practices to create a high-quality infrastructure solution

#### Roadmap.sh DevOps Challenges

Roadmap.sh DevOps challenges provide practical projects from basic server setups to advanced deployments, which **I often extended** by experimenting with my own approaches or tools to further hone my skills

- 🔭 [My Roadmap.sh Repository](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories)
- Highlighted Challenges:

  - [**Automated-Backups**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/automated-backups): Proud of my clever pipeline design using the `dorny/paths-filter` action to skip jobs, reducing execution time
  - [**Dockerized-Service-Deployment**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/dockerized-service-deployment): Utilized a distroless image and implemented caching in the GitHub Actions pipeline to reduce execution time
  - Several other [**intermediate**](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories?q=topic%3Aintermediate) challenges that I extended further honing my DevOps skills
